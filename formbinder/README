= FormBinder Add-on =

== Usage of the add-on ==

This is a pure server side add-on for Vaadin. Most commonly you will 
use ViewBoundForm from this add-on. It extends
the default Form in Vaadin. You will also need to build a view (of 
type ComponentContainer) for your form and then pass it as a constructor 
parameter or via setContent method. See class documenation (javadoc) for
ViewBoundForm for more information.

ViewBoundForm then uses PreCreatedFieldsHelper to find a suitable field
from you view class that it binds to related Property. Most commonly 
a naming convention (propertyId + "Field") is used for mapping, but also
@PropertyId annotation can be used. Downside with the annotation is that
the current version of Vaadin Visual Designer stripts them away.

The PreCreatedFiedlsHelper is usable as a standalone helper aswell. You
may use it e.g. if you need to use another form extension instead (e.g.
BeanValidationForm).

Tests in FormBinderDemoApplication should be 

== Developing and building ==

Project sources are hosted in github.com.

Issue following maven build to package project to a vaadin add-on package:
mvn install

During development one can easily launch embedded jetty server for 
development by running the main method from TestServlet class that runs.

TODO Project uses some Selenium2 tests against the example application 
with FirefoxDriver. They are automatically run during build.

== Building demo app ==

There are no cool demos available ATM. Test packages can be packaged into
servlet3 war with a sources from src/test package.
